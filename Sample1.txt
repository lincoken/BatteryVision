Abstract
Abstract Image
Sulfur exhibits a high theoretical capacity of 1675 mA h g–1 via a distinct conversion reaction, which is different from the insertion reactions in commercial lithium-ion batteries. In consideration of its conversion-reaction battery chemistry, a custom design for electrode materials could establish the way for attaining high-loading capability while simultaneously maintaining high electrochemical utilization and stability. In this study, this process is undertaken by introducing carbon cotton as an attractive electrode-containment material for enhancing the dynamic and static stabilities of lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries. The carbon cotton possessing a hierarchical macro-/microporous architecture exhibits a high surface area of 805 m2 g–1 and high microporosity with a micropore area of 557 m2 g–1. The macroporous channels allow the carbon cotton to load and stabilize a high amount of active material. The abundant microporous reaction sites spread throughout the carbon cotton facilitate the redox chemistry of the high-loading/content Li–S system. As a result, the high-loading carbon-cotton cathode exhibits (i) enhanced cycle stability with a good dynamic capacity retention of 70% after 100 cycles and (ii) improved cell-storage stability with a high static capacity retention of above 93% and a low time-dependent self-discharge rate of 0.12% per day after storing for a long period of 60 days. These carbon-cotton cathodes with the remarkably highest values reported so far of both sulfur loading (61.4 mg cm–2) and sulfur content (80 wt %) demonstrate enhanced electrochemical utilization with the highest areal, volumetric, and gravimetric capacities simultaneously.

With the ever-increasing demand for energy density, the performance of lithium-ion batteries has been steadily improving.(1) As a mature technology, the insertion-compound electrode hosts used in commercial lithium-ion batteries are reaching their maximum charge-storage capacities.(1-4) Going beyond lithium-ion chemistry, a high-capacity sulfur cathode coupled with a lithium–metal anode could offer a high-energy density of 400–600 Wh kg–1. This conversion-reaction battery chemistry has the potential to offer 2–3 times higher energy density than the commercial lithium-ion batteries.(2-4)
In terms of battery chemistry, the lithium–sulfur (Li–S) system is known for its complex chemical and electrochemical processes.(5-10) At the cathode, the insulating sulfur and lithium sulfide cause low electrochemical utilization of the overall capacity.(3-7) Porous carbons and functional polymers have been developed to encapsulate and bond sulfur to form nanocomposites. Sulfur-based nanocomposites must be well mixed with additional conductive carbons to reduce cathode resistance, while these processes reduce the sulfur content and limit the sulfur loading.(3, 4, 8-10) The conversion between sulfur and lithium sulfide involves the formation of polysulfide intermediates (Li2S4–8), which are soluble in the liquid electrolyte used.(5-7) The dissolved polysulfides with high electrochemical activity function as catholytes to facilitate the redox reaction.(11, 12) This implies that electrolyte/catholyte stability should be well designed for boosting the electrochemical-conversion chemistry. However, dissolved polysulfides easily diffuse out from the cathode side and migrate toward the anode side. The polysulfide diffusion leads to active-material loss, lithium–metal corrosion, and insulating Li2S2/Li2S deposition on electrode surface during cell cycling and resting.(5, 7) Electrode instability leads to both dynamic and static irreversible capacity loss.(5-7, 13, 14) In an effort to minimize these negative effects, a variety of cathode architectures have been put forward to retain polysulfides at the cathode side. Polar hosts,(15-18) functional separators,(19-25) polysulfide traps,(26-29) and structural electrodes(30-36) have been employed to offer a long cycle life(35-40) and a low self-discharge effect.(41-43)
Compared to the efforts dedicated to improving the cell cyclability, there is less progress on increasing the high-loading capability in the Li–S system.(9, 14, 37-40, 44, 45) The Li–S battery chemistry involves (i) a solid(sulfur)–liquid(polysulfides)–solid(sulfides) conversion, (ii) active-material rearrangement, and (iii) a cathode-volume change of 80%.(2-7) Coupled with polysulfide diffusion, the electrode instability challenges the development of high-loading sulfur cathodes.(9, 14, 37-40) Moreover, the thickness of the conventional sulfur cathodes is usually <30 µm, which is thinner than that used in Li-ion batteries (>100 µm).(2, 37) A thicker conventional electrode coating for sulfur cathodes has, unfortunately, proved that it is difficult to attain good electrode integrity.(36-39) Given that a traditional Li-ion cathode configuration is not ideal for a Li–S battery, advanced electrode materials with stereoscopic architectures and high flexibility have recently been developed for realizing a high sulfur loading of above 10 mg cm–2 and for achieving a high areal capacity.(4, 36-40) The remaining challenges are how to simultaneously improve the sulfur loading and maintain the necessary dynamic and static cell stabilities via the electrode design in order to take advantage of the high-energy density of Li–S batteries for practical applications.(37-45)
In this study, a flexible carbon-cotton cathode is designed as an attractive electrode-containment material for enhancing the dynamic and static stabilities of a high-loading cathode system. The dynamically and statically stable battery chemistries exhibit, respectively, an excellent capacity retention of 70% after 100 cycles and a low time-dependent self-discharge rate of 0.12% per day after resting for 60 days. The ultrahigh-loading carbon cotton realizing a good balance between sulfur loading (61.4 mg cm–2) and sulfur content (80 wt %) demonstrates the highest areal capacity (56 mA h cm–2), volumetric capacity (1121 mA h cm–3), and gravimetric capacity (724 mA h g–1). To the best of our knowledge, the Li–S batteries presented here with a carbon-cotton cathode exhibit the highest sulfur loading/content and promising dynamic and static battery performances among the results reported in the literature. The enhanced high-loading capacity is up to 3 times higher than the highest values reported in the literature, as shown in Figure 1a,b (see Tables S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information).(30-43)

Results and Discussion
Morphology and Microstructure of Carbon-Cotton Cathodes
Figure 1c illustrates the preparation process of the flexible carbon-cotton cathode. Cotton was carbonized at 900 °C for 6 h under an argon atmosphere to form the carbon cotton (Figure 1d,e). The carbon cotton has a well-maintained porous structure and good mechanical strength. The high flexibility and durability allow the carbon cotton to be bent, rolled, and kneaded, still maintaining good integrity (see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). This suggests that the carbon cotton could accommodate a high amount of active material and tolerate the volume changes.(37-45) The microstructure of the carbon cottons was observed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Figure 2a and Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). The carbon cotton has spiral carbon fibers woven into a long-range conductive network, which ensures a high electrode integrity and fast electron pathways. The spiral carbon fibers armored with nanosized slit pores provide a high surface area of 805 m2 g–1 and high microporosity. Micropores spread throughout the carbon fibers have an estimated pore size of 1 nm and a high micropore area of 557 m2 g–1 (see Table S3 and Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). The carbon skeleton provides a hierarchical macro-/microporous architecture. The large macropore volume allows the carbon cotton to load with and stabilize a high amount of active material.(30-32, 45) The abundant microporous reaction sites facilitate the redox chemistry of the high-loading/content carbon-cotton cathodes.(32, 45)

Dynamic and Static Battery Performances
To adopt the hierarchical macro-/microporous architecture, the carbon cottons were used as the electrode-containment material in a Li–S cell with polysulfide (Li2S6) catholyte as the starting active material.(32, 46) The carbon-cotton cathodes loaded with a high sulfur loading of 30.7 mg cm–2 have a sulfur content of 80 wt %. Figure 2b shows the morphological and elemental changes in the carbon-cotton cathodes after 100 cycles. On the other hand, Figure 2c shows the microstructural changes in the carbon-cotton cathodes after resting for 60 days. Both cycled and rested carbon-cotton cathodes exhibit a well-maintained coalescing carbon-fiber network and porous channels. No agglomerated active material covers the carbon-cotton cathodes nor blocks their porous catholyte channels, as compared to those observed with the pristine carbon cotton. Thus, the unblocked conductive carbon-fiber network and the macroporous electrolyte channels supply smooth electron and ion pathways to the active material stabilized within the carbon-cotton cathode.(30, 32, 42) The elemental mapping results display the high intensity of sulfur signals and their uniform dispersion within the carbon-cotton matrix, demonstrating the excellent encapsulation of a high amount of active material within the carbon-cotton cathodes. Under a high-magnification observation (see Figures S4–S6 in the Supporting Information), the cycled and rested carbon-cotton cathodes show that their spiral carbon fibers are characterized by the recrystallization and infiltration of the sulfur-containing species. A close connection between the active material and the conductive skeleton, offering a fast electron pathway, enhances the redox reaction kinetics.(14, 30-34) Coupled with a highly accessible reaction area and stereoscopic electrolyte channels, the carbon-cotton cathodes facilitate and persevere the high-loading/content active material with excellent redox chemistry during, respectively, dynamic cell cycling and static cell resting.(41-43, 45-49)
The enhanced high-loading Li–S battery chemistries brought about by the carbon-cotton cathodes were studied by examining the dynamic and static battery performances. Figure 2d shows the dynamic battery performances of the carbon-cotton cathodes with high sulfur loading and content of, respectively, 30.7 mg cm–2 and 80 wt %. The cells have peak discharge capacities of 1173 and 905 mA h g–1 at C/10 and C/5 rates. Before reaching the peak capacities, the cells exhibit an increase in charge-storage capacities during the initial 5 and 14 cycles at, respectively, C/10 and C/5 rates, as shown in rectangles in Figure 2d. The initial capacity increase is attributed to the activation of high-loading active material.(36) During this process, the active material rearranges to electrochemically favorable positions within the carbon-cotton cathodes so as to improve the reaction kinetics. Therefore, the activated high-loading active-material cores enable the corresponding cells to deliver increasing charge-storage capacities.(14, 24)
After 100 cycles, the reversible capacities remain at 788 and 638 mA h g–1, corresponding to high dynamic capacity-retention rates of 67% and 71%. These features provide electrochemical evidence that the carbon-cotton cathodes simultaneously possess (i) high-loading capacity for raising the loading and content of the active material and (ii) excellent electrochemical quality with high utilization and retention.(37, 40, 45) In consideration of the high sulfur loading, the areal capacities are raised to 36 and 28 mA h cm–2,(38, 41-43) but so would the electrode thickness. The increasing thickness of the electrodes would influence the volumetric capacity and could remain as a new challenge for high-loading sulfur cathodes. However, not much literature points out this problem in pursuing high-loading cathodes.(8, 14, 37-40) A possible solution to ameliorate the volumetric capacity issue is to fill up the high-loading cathode with a high content of sulfur.(14, 47) With a sulfur content of 80 wt %, Figure 2e displays the improved volumetric capacities of 1201 and 927 mA h cm–3 at C/10 and C/5 rates. As a result of the high sulfur content, the gravimetric capacities attain 930 and 718 mA h g–1.(36-39, 47) The excellent dynamic battery performances could conclude that the carbon-cotton cathodes exhibit a good balance between the high sulfur loading and content as well as the areal, volumetric, and gravimetric capacities.
The static Li–S battery performances with a long-term cell storage have only been investigated by very few studies,(5, 41-43, 48) and corresponding high-loading studies are even rarer. Figure 2f shows the self-discharge effect of the carbon-cotton cathodes resting at uncycled and fully discharged states for 60 days. At both the cell-storage conditions, the cells display almost constant open-circuit voltage (OCV) values, indicating the static chemical and electrochemical stability. In the first case, the cell resting at uncycled state remained 94% of its original charge-storage capacity, corresponding to a low static capacity-fade rate, the time-dependent self-discharge rate, of 0.10% per day. This indicates the excellent polysulfide-retention capability of the carbon-cotton cathode because the uncycled cells were examined with the existence of a high content of polysulfide catholytes in the cathode.(5, 48) In the second case, the cell resting at the fully discharged state hold 93% of its original charge-storage capacity with a low time-dependent self-discharge rate of 0.12% per day. This demonstrates that the redox chemistry was not impacted by the formation of insulating reduction products (Li2S2/Li2S).(41-43, 48) The stable OCV values, high static charge-storage capacities, and low capacity-fade rate evidence the excellent static cell stability associated with the carbon-cotton cathodes.
Benefiting from the improved dynamic electrochemical properties, the high loading/content carbon-cotton cathode exhibits good rate capability from a low C/20 rate, showing the good polysulfide retention, to a high 2C rate, displaying the improved reaction capability (Figure 3a).(14, 26, 40) After completing the 2C rate measurement, the cells display a high reversible capacity of 1022 mA h g–1 at C/20 rate (the 71st cycle). The high electrochemical reversibility displays a low capacity fade of <0.025%, as compared to the initial C/20-rate measurement. This demonstrates the excellent rate capability of the carbon-cotton cathodes. On the other hand, after assessing the rate capability, the cells continuously cycle at C/10 rate, maintaining a superior cycle stability (from the 91st to the 150th cycles). The capacity retention after 150 cycles is 92% with a low capacity-fade rate of only 0.07% per cycle. In Figure 3b, the carbon-cotton cathodes demonstrate that their ultrahigh-loading capability is able to further increase the high sulfur loading from 30.7 to 61.4 mg cm–2 and still keeps a high sulfur content of 80 wt % with good cyclability. The high-loading/content cathodes provide Li–S cells with a peak discharge capacity of 912 mA h g–1 and a high capacity retention of 77% at C/10 rate after 50 cycles. The corresponding areal, volumetric, and gravimetric capacities are, respectively, 56 mA h cm-2, 1121 mA h cm-3, and 724 mA h g–1. As summarized in Figure 1a, the carbon-cotton cathodes presented here attain the highest sulfur loading/content, which is 3 times higher than the values reported in literature for Li–S cells with high loading. In addition, benefiting from the hierarchical macro-/microporous architecture, the high-loading carbon-cotton cathodes simultaneously exhibit (i) promising dynamic battery performances with high charge-storage capacities and good cyclability and (ii) long-term cell-storage capacity with high capacity retention during long-term resting as compared to the values reported in the literature so far (see Tables S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information).(30-43)

Dynamic and Static Electrochemical Analyses
The dynamically and statically stable battery chemistries are analyzed in Figures 4 and 5. Two different cyclic voltammograms (CV) summarized in Figure 4a,b demonstrate the improved electrochemical stability and the smooth Li-ion diffusion.(19, 25) In Figure 4a, the reversible CV curves at a scanning rate of 0.05 mV s–1 display the two-step redox reaction during the lithiation/delithiaton processes of sulfur, involving two cathodic peaks (C1 and C2) and continuous anodic peaks (A1). The C1 and C2 peaks correspond to, respectively, the reduction of sulfur to polysulfides(3, 22, 27) and the reduction of polysulfides to solid reduction products, Li2S2/Li2S.(19, 25) The broad A1 peak represents the oxidation reaction from Li2S2/Li2S to Li2S8/S.(3, 23) The CV curves show no obvious peak and current changes, demonstrating the improved electrochemical stability.(19, 21) Figure 4b,c displays, respectively, the rate-dependent CV scanning and the mathematical calculation of the Li-ion diffusion coefficient (DLi+).(19, 25) The DLi+ values of C1, C2, and A1 peaks are, respectively, 8.19 × 10–9, 2.29 × 10–8, and 3.85 × 10–8 cm2 s–1. The experimental DLi+ values are close to the reference values reported in the literature (DLi+ = 2 × 10–8 – 9 × 10–9 cm2 s–1),(19, 25) demonstrating the smooth Li-ion diffusion. The cell resistance and reaction kinetics were investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS, see Figure S7 in the Supporting Information).(13, 25, 49) Both uncycled and cycled cells display low resistance values, evidencing that the conductive carbon cotton and the electrochemically active catholyte improve the cathode conductivity.(13, 49) According to the CV and EIS analyses, the smooth ion and electron transport within the high-loading/content carbon-cotton cathodes should improve the redox chemistry so that the cells are able to be normally operated and attain good electrochemical performances.

The enhanced redox chemistry is subsequently characterized by the discharge/charge curves at C/10 and C/5 rates (see Figure S8 in the Supporting Information). The overlapping discharge/charge curves show no severe capacity or voltage fades, which reconfirms the highly reversible redox reactions.(3, 22, 23) By examining the discharge/charge curves, the voltage hysteresis (?E), upper-plateau discharge capacity (QH), and lower-plateau discharge capacity (QL) provide more electrochemical characteristics in supporting the enhanced dynamically stable Li–S battery chemistry.(21, 23, 25, 28)
In Figure S9 (Supporting Information), the ?E values represent the voltage separation between the discharge and charge curves. At C/10 and C/5 rates, the ?E values decrease, respectively, from 0.38 to 0.29 V and from 0.46 to 0.40 V after the initial activation(24) and subsequently remain at 0.27 and 0.38 V during the following cycling. Low-voltage hysteresis demonstrates fast redox reaction kinetics brought about by the electrochemically active catholyte and conductive carbon-cotton electrode.(23-25) The QH value indicates the polysulfide-diffusion status and reflects the possible polysulfide retention because the upper plateau region involves the formation, dissolution, and migration of polysulfides.(3, 21, 23, 27) Despite a high amount of catholyte loading, the utilization rates of QH approach 80% at C/10 rate and 60% at C/5 rate (Figure 4d). After 100 cycles, the QH retention rates attain 63% at C/10 rate and 73% at C/5 rate. Such high QH utilization and retention suggest the reduced polysulfide diffusion.(7, 23) The QL value illustrates the reduction capability of the cells due to the slow liquid(polysulfides)–solid(sulfides) transformation in the lower plateau region.(3, 5, 21) In consideration of the formation of solid redox products, the tendency of the QL as a function of cycle numbers also reflects the capability of the carbon-cotton cathodes to eliminate the redeposition of the insulating Li2S2/Li2S layer on their surface and to inhibit the formation of agglomerated active-material buildup within their porous spaces.(7, 23) The long lower discharge plateaus maintain well, such that the carbon-cotton cathodes exhibit a high retention rate in their QL of 60+% at various cycling rates after 100 cycles (Figure 4e). The high QL retention represents a thorough reduction of the stabilized active material and excellent electrochemical reversibility.(7, 23, 27) In general, ?E, QH, and QL analyses and their favorable features explain why the carbon-cotton cathodes could enhance high-loading capability and simultaneously maintain the improved dynamic battery performances.
The statically stable Li–S battery chemistry was analyzed by a mathematical model at the uncycled and fully discharged states.(5, 41-43) In Figure 4f, the self-discharge constant (Ks) is examined by comparing the QH values before and after resting as a function of the resting time.(5, 43) The Ks values of the carbon-cotton cathodes resting at uncycled and fully discharged states were, respectively, 0.0089 and 0.0076 day–1. The Ks values are lower than the values of the cathodes with low sulfur loadings of 1–4 mg cm–2.(5, 43, 48) Due to the high amount of polysulfide catholyte in the carbon-cotton cathode, the low Ks demonstrates the good polysulfide-retention capability of the carbon-cotton cathodes so that the corresponding cells possess enhanced static stability during a long cell-storage period.(41-43)
Besides a series of quantitative analysis, a polysulfide-trap cell that had a carbon-paper layer inserted between two layers of separators as a “polysulfide trap” was utilized for qualitatively evaluating the presence or absence of polysulfide diffusion in the carbon-cotton cathode. The polysulfide-trap cell is configured with a carbon-cotton cathode, a first layer of a separator, a carbon-paper layer (as the polysulfide trap), a second layer of a separator, and a lithium-foil anode (Figure 5a).(36) In Figure 5b,c, the polysulfide traps retrieved from the cells after 100 cycles and resting for 60 days exhibit a well-maintained porous carbon network. Although a high amount of dissolved polysulfide catholyte was directly loaded into the carbon-cotton cathode, the cycled polysulfide trap (Figures 5b) revealed strong elemental carbon signals and very limited sulfur signals. The corresponding elemental mapping results show that the polysulfide trap is almost sulfur-free. This demonstrates the suppressed polysulfide diffusion and confirms the superior dynamic polysulfide-retention capability of the carbon-cotton cathodes. On the other hand, in Figure 5c, the rested carbon-cotton cathodes stayed at a high-polysulfide concentration condition for a long cell-storage period. The polysulfide trap retrieved from the rested cells exhibited low elemental sulfur signals. This demonstrates that the carbon-cotton cathode also possesses an excellent static polysulfide-retention capability. In summary, these quantitative and qualitative electrochemical examinations summarized in Figures 4 and 5 demonstrate the attracting high-loading capacity and dynamic/static polysulfide retention brought about by the carbon-cotton cathode.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the carbon-cotton cathodes provide a facile and practical solution for developing high performance Li–S cells with a high-loading capacity, achieving a superior active-material loading and content of 61.4 mg cm–2 and 80 wt %. The carbon-cotton electrode has a cross-linked spiral carbon-fiber network that is armored with microporous reaction sites. Stereoscopic macroporous architecture allows the carbon-cotton cathode to encapsulate a high amount of catholyte. The high tortuosity of the carbon-cotton cathode benefits the catholyte infiltration and the ensuing active-material retention. The abundant micropores enlarge the accessible reaction area among electrons, catholyte, and active material, guaranteeing the smooth operation of high-loading/content cathodes. Therefore, the cells employing the carbon-cotton cathodes display outstanding dynamic redox chemistry and exhibit a dynamic capacity-retention rate of 70%. The corresponding cells exhibit high areal, volumetric, and gravimetric capacities. The statically stable battery chemistry demonstrates a low self-discharge effect with a high static capacity retention of 93% after resting for 60 days. The performance and electrochemical enhancements make the carbon-cotton cathodes an advanced electrode material for developing the high-loading/content Li–S batteries.
Methods
Carbon-Cotton Cathode Fabrication
The carbon cotton was fabricated by simply carbonizing cotton at 900 °C for 6 h with a heating rate of 2 °C min–1 in a tube furnace under argon atmosphere. Pure cotton was retrieved from commercial cotton pads. After carbonization, cotton converted into a lightweight stereoscopic carbon matrix that well retained the original fluffy and porous morphology of cotton. The carbon cotton intrinsically possesses superior flexibility, durability, and mechanical strength (see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). The carbon cotton was cut into a square with a uniform size of 5 × 5 mm. The average thicknesses and masses of the carbon cottons used to load 30.7 mg cm–2 sulfur loading in the cathodes were, respectively, 300 µm and 1.9 mg cm–2. The corresponding values for a higher sulfur loading of 61.4 mg cm–2 were, respectively, 500 µm and 3.7 mg cm–2.
In order to adopt these natural benefits, the carbon cotton was directly used as the electrode-containment material without additional modifications. For example, the carbon-cotton cathodes with an ultrahigh sulfur loading were prepared by impregnating the carbon cotton with a high amount of electrochemically active Li2S6 catholytes (80 µL) inside an argon-filled glovebox. The resulting carbon-cotton cathodes contained high sulfur loading and content of up to 61.4 mg cm–2 and 80 wt %, respectively. Both values are higher than the values reported so far in the literature (Figure 1a,b). The superior mechanical strength of the conductive carbon network allows the resulting carbon-cotton cathodes to be free-standing. No extra binders, conductive carbon additives, and aluminum-foil current collectors were applied in the cathode preparation, which might simplify the fabrication processes. The Li2S6 catholyte was prepared by mixing commercial sulfur powder (Acros Organics) and Li2S powder (Acros Organics) in a regular 1:1 volume ratio of 1,3-dioxolane (DOL, Acros Organics)/1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME, Acros Organics) electrolyte with 1.85 M LiCF3SO3 (Acros Organics) and 0.1 M LiNO3 (Acros Organics) cosalts. The precursor solution was heated for 48 h at 50 °C to produce the dissolved polysulfide catholytes. The catholytes contained 6 M sulfur in the solution. The anolyte, a blank electrolyte, was prepared by dissolving 1.85 M LiCF3SO3 and 0.1 M LiNO3 cosalts in the same 1:1 volume ratio of DOL/DME electrolyte.
Electrochemical Cell Assembly
The carbon-cotton cathode was, subsequently, assembled into a CR2032-type coin cell in an argon-filled glovebox with a Celgard 2500 monolayer polypropylene (PP) membrane (Celgard), a lithium-foil anode (Aldrich), a nickel-foam spacer (Pred Materials, Inc.), and a blank electrolyte. The cell contained an electrolyte-to-sulfur ratio of 6.8. The electrolyte-to-sulfur ratio was based on the total amount of electrolyte and mass of sulfur used in the cells. The assembled cells were allowed to rest for 30 min at 25 °C before analysis and electrochemical measurements. In order to normalize the electrochemical characteristics and the corresponding analysis, the cells employing the high-loading/content cathodes were controlled in a stable OCV value of 2.35 ± 0.05 V. The yielding rate of the qualified cells was 90+%.
Polysulfide-Trap Cell Fabrication
In this work, a favorable catholyte infiltration and superior polysulfide retention within the carbon-cotton cathode are the important prerequisites for the high sulfur loading/content cathodes to normally function and subsequently exhibit dynamically and statically stable electrochemical characteristics. Thus, a polysulfide-trap cell was applied for the investigation of polysulfide retention or diffusion during cell cycling and resting. The polysulfide-trap cell was configured with a carbon-cotton cathode, the first layer of a separator, a carbon-paper layer (as the polysulfide trap, with 20 µL blank electrolyte), the second layer of a separator, a lithium-foil anode (Aldrich), a nickel-foam spacer (Pred Materials, Inc.), and a blank electrolyte (20 µL). The electrolyte-to-sulfur ratio in the polysulfide-trap cell was increased to 9.4. The assembled polysulfide-trap cells were allowed to rest for 30 min at 25 °C before analysis and electrochemical measurements.
Materials Characterization
Microstructural analysis was conducted with a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Quanta 650, FEI) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX) for detecting the elemental signals and collecting the elemental mapping signals. The cycled carbon-cotton cathodes and cycled polysulfide traps (at charge state, 100 cycles) were retrieved inside an argon-filled glovebox 30 min prior to the analysis. The cycled carbon-cotton cathodes were rinsed with a 1:1 volume ratio of DOL/DME solution for 5 min, wiped with Kimwipes, and transported into an argon-filled sealed vessel. The cycled polysulfide traps were rinsed with a DOL solution for 5 min because DME is a polar solvent with high solubility for polysulfides. The rested carbon-cotton cathodes and the polysulfide traps inserted in the polysulfide-trap cells after resting for 60 days were utilized for examining the static morphological and elemental changes. Due to the use of polysulfide catholyte in cathodes, the rested SEM samples were also rinsed with a DOL solution for 5 min.
The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were measured at 77 K with an automated gas sorption analyzer (AutoSorb iQ2, Quantachrome Instruments). Specific surface area was calculated with the 7-points Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method with a correlation coefficient of above 0.999. The pore-size distributions and pore volumes were determined by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda method for investigating the broad pore-size distributions, Horvath–Kawazoe method for analyzing the micropore filling behavior, and a density functional theory model for characterizing the meso-/micropore adsorptions. The analysis of microporosity was calculated by Dubinin–Astakov/Dubinin–Radushkevic theories and T-plot method under a porous carbon model. Each analysis model has a specific analytical range for the corresponding porosity characteristics so that Figure S3 and Table S3 display a comprehensive and in-depth porosity analysis.
Dynamically Electrochemical Measurements and Analysis
CV measurements were evaluated with a universal potentiostat (VoltaLab PGZ 402, Radiometer Analytical). The cells employing the carbon-cotton cathodes were charged from OCV to 3.0 V as the initial charge. Subsequently, the cells were scanned between 1.5 and 3.0 V at a scan rate of 0.05 mV s–1 and stopped at the charged state after 10 cycles. The rate-dependent CV curves were based on the fifth CV scan. The examined cells were cycled for four cycles at C/10 rate initially for completing the activation process. The precycling step ensured that the examined CV cells have similar and qualified electrochemical conditions and characteristics. The lithium-ion diffusion coefficient (DLi+) was examined by the Randles–Sevick equation:

where Ipeak is the peak current, e is the number of electrons, area is the cathode area, concnLi+ is the concentration of Li ions in the electrolyte, and rate is the CV scanning rate. The data points were collected from the rate-dependent CV plots at various scanning rates (0.1, 0.05, and 0.02 mV s–1).(19, 24) The discharge/charge profiles and cyclability data were collected with a programmable battery cycler (Arbin Instruments). After a resting period of 30 min, the cells were first charged from OCV to 3.0 V and then cycled between 1.5 and 3.0 V for a full cycle at C/10 and C/5 rates. The voltage hysteresis (?E) was defined to be the voltage difference between the middle of the charge and discharge curves. The discharge capacity (mA h g–1) was calculated based on the mass of sulfur. The areal capacity (mA h cm–2), volumetric capacity (mA h cm–3), and gravimetric capacity (mA h g–1) were calculated per cathode. The QH and QL analyses were calculated from the discharge data points and based on the values of the theoretical QH and QL capacities, which were 419 and 1256 mA h g–1. The dynamic capacity-retention rates (dynamic RQ) were calculated by Q100th/Qpeak × 100% = dynamic RQ, where Q100th is the reversible capacity after 100 cycles and Qpeak is the peak discharge capacity. In consideration of the initial activation processes, the dynamic capacity-retention rate was calculated based on the peak capacity of the corresponding cells, which gives a fair comparison.(24)
Static Electrochemical Measurements and Analysis
The self-discharge effect was examined by using the uncycled and fully discharged Li–S cells after resting for 15, 30, and 60 days at room temperature. Two different cell-storage conditions were investigated for building a comprehensive understanding. The cells resting at the uncycled state aimed to display the effect of polysulfide diffusion toward the static cell stability because the existence of a high amount of polysulfide catholyte in the cells during long-term resting. On the other hand, the cells resting at the fully discharged state aimed to verify the relationship between the formation of discharged products, insulating Li2S2/Li2S, and the static redox chemistry. The static battery electrochemistry was studied by the changes of charge-storage capacities, OCV values, static capacity-retention rate, static capacity-fade rates, self-discharge constant, and polysulfide-trap cells. The static capacity-retention rate (static RQ) was calculated by Qself-discharge/Qpeak × 100% = static RQ. The static capacity-fade rates (self-discharge rate, Rself-discharge) were calculated by two methods: (i) (Qpeak – Qself-discharge)/Qpeak × 100% = Rself-discharge and (ii) (Qpeak – Qself-discharge)/Qpeak/TR × 100% = time-dependent Rself-discharge. The time-dependent Rself-discharge was introduced because some references reported a low self-discharge effect based on a short resting time. In these equations, Qpeak is the peak discharge capacity of the cell resting for 0 days, Qself-discharge is the charge-storage capacity after resting for 60 days, and TR is the resting time. The self-discharge constant that quantifies the self-discharge level of Li–S cells was determined by a mathematical model: ln(QH/QH0) = -Ks × TR, where QH is the upper-plateau charge-storage capacity, QH0 is the peak upper-plateau charge-storage capacity, Ks is the self-discharge constant, and TR is the resting time.(5, 43)
