**Abstract:** To acquire remarkable cathode materials for lithium-sulfur
batteries with ultrahigh utilization of active materials and superior cycling
stability, we firstly employ carboxylated carbon nanotubes to prepare the
NiCo2S4@CNTs/S for lithium-sulfur batteries via a simple hydrothermal method,
following by a low temperature annealing. The NiCo2S4@CNTs presents a unique
structure, which possesses thin branches filled with densely packed small
leaves where a large number of micropores distribute. In the novel
superstructure, carboxylated carbon nanotubes can effectively improve the
electronic transportation capacity and conductivity of the cathode material.
In lithium-sulfur batteries, bimetal sulfides have a strong adsorption of the
polysulfides, effectively suppressing the diffusion of lithium polysulfides.
The NiCo2S4@CNTs/S electrode shows a capacity of 788 mA h g(-1) at the current
density of 0.5 C and 758 mA h g(-1) at 2 C. Even after 1000 cycles at the
current density of 0.6 C the capacity only decays by 0.0489% each cycle. It
should be notes that most of Coulombic efficiency of the NiCo2S4@CNTs/S
electrode is about 99%, regardless of the current density. More importantly,
the NiCo2S4@CNTs can exhibit an outstanding capability of absorbing lithium
polysulfides, which provides a promising strategy for preparing advanced
lithium-sulfur batteries.

**Abstract:** The practical application of Li-S batteries is inherently
limited by the low conductivity of sulfur and the dissolution of polysulfides.
The enhancement of conductivity and introduction of polarity to the sulfur
host is an effective strategy to overcome these long-standing challenges. In
this work, a facile one-step carbonizing process is used to synthesize a
unique porous and conducive nanocomposite where Fe3C nanoparticles are
embedded in nitrogen-doped porous carbon sheets (Fe3C@NPCS). As demonstrated
in Li2S4 adsorption experiments and confirmed by density functional theory
calculations, Fe3C nanoparticles are able to strongly adsorb polysulfides via
strong Fe-S chemical bonds. Due to the remarkable conductivity, Fe3C
nanoparticles can also accelerate the electrochemical reactions of the
polysulfides through fast electron transportation. The carbon sheets prevent
the aggregation of Fe3C nanoparticles and accommodate sulfur and its volume
expansion during charge/discharge processes. With these features, the
resultant sulfur cathodes (Fe3C@NPCS-S) deliver an excellent cycling
performance with a capacity decay of 0.036% per cycle, and high rate
performance of ca. 1127, 1020, 907, 802, 731 and 647 mAh g(-1) under current
densities of 0.3, 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 5 C, respectively.

**Abstract:** A UV-light polymerized three-dimensional (3D) network gel
polymer electrolyte (GPE) is designed and fabricated for solid-state lithium-
sulfur (Li-S) batteries. The GPE exhibits wide electrochemical window up to
5.05 V (vs. Li+/Li), outstanding thermostability and mechanical property.
Besides, the GPE effectively suppresses the extension of lithium dendrite and
the electron-donating groups in GPE inhibit the shuttle of lithium
polysulfides. The assembled solid-state Li-S batteries with the 3D network GPE
show high specific capacity retention of 69.1% after 300 cycles at 0.5 C. With
the consideration of these, the GPE in this report undoubtedly provides an
effective technique to design high performance solid-state Li-S batteries.

**Abstract:** An ideal sulfur supporting material for lithium-sulfur battery
should simultaneously incorporate the features of polysulfides
adsorption/trapping and high conductivity, which are important for achieving
good cycle performance and finally practical use. In this work, accordion-like
titanium oxides-Ti3C2 MXene (Ti3C2Ox) hetero-structure was synthesized via a
fast annealing treatment to Ti3C2 MXene (Ti3C2) in air. Oxidation temperature
plays a key role on the formation of accordion-like Ti3C2Ox. The synthesized
Ti3C2Ox material under 500 degrees C exhibits the most optimal structure,
which presents the evenly distributed titanium oxides on the Ti3C2 nanosheets.
This heterostructural material combines the high chemical adsorption ability
of titanium oxides for LiPSs and good electronic conductivity of Ti3C2. After
infiltrating with sulfur, a substantial specific capacity of 662 mAh g(-1) is
achieved after 1000 cycles at 1 C (1.675 A g(-1)), corresponding to a very low
capacity fading of 0.053% per cycle. Additionally, a reversible capacity of
367 mAh g(-1) is still obtained at a high rate of 10 C. The Ti3C2Ox
synthesized by the facile oxidation treatment is a highly promising electrode
material and contributes to accelerate the practical use of Li-S battery.

**Title:** Modification of cobalt-containing MOF-derived mesoporous carbon as
an effective sulfur-loading host for rechargeable lithium-sulfur batteries  
**Author(s):** Yu, FQ (Yu, Faqi); Zhou, H (Zhou, He); Shen, Q (Shen, Qiang)

**Abstract:** Cobalt-containing metal-organic frameworks (MOF) are
synthesized, then carbonized and then acid etched to obtain mesoporous carbon
for its potential application as lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery cathode
scaffolds. Before etching the resulting mesoporous carbon acquires a specific
surface area of 206.5 m(2) g(-1) and a pore volume of 0.29 cm(3) g(-1), and in
its sulfur-loading composite-1 the S-content is similar to 45.2 wt%. After
etching the modified mesoporous carbon exhibits a great improvement in
porosity (Surface area similar to 650.2 m(2) g(-1) and pore volume -0.77 cm(3)
g(-1)) and/or in sulfur-loading amount (i. e., the S-content of composite
similar to 2 - 50.0 wt%). At 0.5 C (1 C = 1675 mA g(-1)), a composite-2
cathode delivers a high discharge capacity of 925.1 mAh g(-1) in 2nd cycle and
maintains a specific value of 781.1 mAh g(-1) in the 140th cycle, much higher
than those of composite-1 cathode. Both of the two composite electrodes
display a slight increase of electrolyte-solution resistance and surface-film
resistance and an obvious decrease of chargetransfer resistance. By
comparison, these resistances of composite-2 are smaller than those of
composite1. This, together with the acid-modified structural parameters
reasonably account for the enhanced electrochemical properties of composite-2.

**Abstract:** A nano-magnesium nickel oxide-mesoporous carbon/sulfur
composites (Mg0.6Ni0.4O-MPC/S) was designed and prepared for lithium-sulfur
(Li-S) batteries. With a specific surface area as high as 1001.2 m(2) g(-1)
and a unique porous structure, MPC in the composites can not only absorb the
polysulfides generated during charge-discharge process to slow down the
shuttle effect, but provide Li+ with a transmission channel. Nano-Mg0.6Ni0.4O
(40 nm) particles, as an additive fabricated by self-propagating high
temperature synthesis, can promote chemical bond dissociation with
polysulfides and accelerate the electrochemical reaction rate. The composites
loaded with 59 wt% sulfur exhibit a high initial capacity of 1360 mAh g(-1) at
0.1 C and 695 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles, proving that the synergistic effect
between MPC and Nano-Mg0.6Ni0.4O leads to good cycle stability of the
batteries. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

**Abstract:** Herein, multifunctional Co3O4 nanotubes (Co3O4-T) are
successfully constructed via a low-cost and template-free route, which show a
tubular structure with mesoporous and hollow interior. The as-prepared Co3O4-T
exhibit superior cycling performances, rate capabilities and strong cycling
stability when used as the electrode materials in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs)
and lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs). The Co3O4-T electrode delivers a high
specific capacity of similar to 1081 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 100 mAh
g(-1) after 50 cycles in LIBs. Besides, it also shows a high initial discharge
capacity of 1049.3 mAh g-1 and low overpotential of 154 mV at 0.2 C in LSBs.
These excellent electrochemical performances of Co3O4-T electrode are
attributed to the unique tubular structure with small-sized mesoporous, which
facilitates Li+ diffusion and enhances structural robustness.

**Title:** Multifunctional flexible composite aerogels constructed through in-
situ growth of metal-organic framework nanoparticles on bacterial cellulose  
**Author(s):** Ma, XT (Ma, Xiaoting); Lou, Y (Lou, Yue); Chen, XB (Chen, Xiao-
Bo); Shi, Z (Shi, Zhan); Xu, Y (Xu, Yan)

**Abstract:** Flexible metal-organic framework (MOF) aerogels with practical
macroscopic shapeability and hierarchical porosity were prepared through in-
site growth of MOF nanoparticles, i.e. zeolitic imidazolate framework-8
(ZIF-8) and University of Oslo-66 (UiO-66), on bacteria cellulose (BC). The
yielded composite aerogels inherit high porosities from feedstock MOFs and
mechanical flexibility from BC template. BC template offers high porosity,
mechanical flexibility to the composite aerogels, which significantly
suppresses the aggregation of individual MOF nanoparticles. Owing to the
structural characteristics of MOF and BC, BC@ZIF-8 composite aerogel sponges
exhibit a low density below 0.03 g cm(-3), hierarchical porosity, large
surface area, high mass transfer efficiency and superior adsorption
performance of heavy metal ions. After 24 h adsorption in simulated industrial
waterwastes, removal efficiency of the composite aerogels reaches up to 81%
with respect to Pb2+ ion pollutants, which is 1.2 times higher than that of
original ZIF-8 nanoparticle counterparts. BC@UiO-66 composite aerogel film, as
a flexible lithium-sulfur battery interlayer, demonstrates a high reversible
capacity of 631 mAh g(-1) at 0.5C over 100 cycles, which is attributed to its
selectivity for Li+ ions and efficient inhibition to the soluble polysulfide
ions. In addition, the presence of polydopamine (PDA) coating on BC@UiO-66
nanofibers in BC@UiO-66@ PDA composite aerogel films increases reversible
capacity up to 739 mAh g(-1) at 0.5C over 100 cycles. This work provides a
feasible solution to process MOF powders into a flexible and tailorable form,
and holds a new promise to rational design and manufacturing of MOF monoliths
with a great structural diversity as advanced multifunctional materials.

**Abstract:** The use of sulfur as a cathode material for lithium-sulfur
(Li-S) batteries has attracted significant attention due to its high
theoretical specific capacity (1675 mA h g(-1)); however, practicality is
hindered by a number of obstacles, including the shuttling effect of
polysulfides and the low electrical conductivity of sulfur. Herein, ball
milling sulfur with unzipped multiwalled carbon nanotubes (UMWNTs) was found
to covalently immobilize sulfur nanoparticles to the UMWNTs and resulted in
composites (designated as S@UMWNTs) with high electrical conductivity. The
unzipping degree of MWNTs was first controlled to optimize the immobilization
of sulfur nanoparticles to UMWNTs and the electrochemical performance of the
resulting Li-S batteries. The presence of C-S covalent bonds between the
UMWNTs and sulfur nanoparticles was verified using x-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and the formation of
C-S bonds was ascribed to the reactions between the mechanically-induced
sulfur radicals and the functional groups of UMWNTs. As a result, when used as
a cathode material for Li-S batteries, the S@UMWNTs exhibited excellent
electrochemical performance, including a good long-term cycling stability and
low capacity decay (e.g., ca. 0.09% per cycle over 500 charge/discharge cycles
at 1 C) due to the suppression of the shuttling effect by the C-S covalent
bonds.

**Abstract:** Lithium-sulfur batteries are considered the most promising next-
generation electrochemical energy storage devices due to their high
theoretical energy density. However, their practical application is hindered
by the severe shuttle effect of polysulfides and the low conductivity of
sulfur cathode. Herein, we design a titanium nitride host with a three-
dimensional honeycomb-like structure via a spray drying method, which has the
advantages of metallic conductivity and ultrafast anchoring to realize
efficient adsorption and conversion of polysulfide. The honeycomb-like
architecture can shorten the diffusion path of lithium ions, and buffer the
volume change of sulfur, which can improve reaction kinetics and maintain the
stability of the material structure. As a result, the sulfur cathode based on
titanium nitride host exhibits an excellent cycling performance with a stable
capacity of 650.4 mAh g(-1) within 500 cycles at 100 mA g(-1). The excellent
performance shows the importance of designing cathode materials with
reasonable structures in lithium sulfur batteries.
