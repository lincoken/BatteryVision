      "polysulfides and the low electrical conductivity of sulfur. Herein, ball\n",
      "milling sulfur with unzipped multiwalled carbon nanotubes (UMWNTs) was found\n",
      "to covalently immobilize sulfur nanoparticles to the UMWNTs and resulted in\n",
      "composites (designated as S@UMWNTs) with high electrical conductivity. The\n",
      "unzipping degree of MWNTs was first controlled to optimize the immobilization\n",
      "of sulfur nanoparticles to UMWNTs and the electrochemical performance of the\n",
      "resulting Li-S batteries. The presence of C-S covalent bonds between the\n",
      "UMWNTs and sulfur nanoparticles was verified using x-ray photoelectron\n",
      "spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and the formation of\n",
      "C-S bonds was ascribed to the reactions between the mechanically-induced\n",
      "sulfur radicals and the functional groups of UMWNTs. As a result, when used as\n",
      "a cathode material for Li-S batteries, the S@UMWNTs exhibited excellent\n",
      "electrochemical performance, including a good long-term cycling stability and\n",
      "low capacity decay (e.g., ca. 0.09% per cycle over 500 charge/discharge cycles\n",
      "at 1 C) due to the suppression of the shuttling effect by the C-S covalent\n",
      "bonds.  \n",

      "generation electrochemical energy storage devices due to their high\n",

      "efficient adsorption and conversion of polysulfide. The honeycomb-like\n",

      "volume change of sulfur, which can improve reaction kinetics and maintain the\n",
      "stability of the material structure. As a result, the sulfur cathode based on\n",
      "titanium nitride host exhibits an excellent cycling performance with a stable\n",
      "capacity of 650.4 mAh g(-1) within 500 cycles at 100 mA g(-1). The excellent\n",
